Joy Mafalo ST1056630 

This website showcases all the different services conducted by the organisation solemly focusing on gardening services for residential and commercial clients.

Easy navigation pane from webpage to webpage that allows customers to scroll up and down on each webpage. Part 1 of the project showcases my html structure for the website it includes a homepage, aboutus page, contactus page, enquiery page and a services page.

In order to cater to the various screen devices breakpoints and media queries have been used to make sure the user has a seamless user experience whether that be from a tablet,mobile device or laptop.

The website is does not contain  a loading page as stated in the proposal it was deliberately left out to properly introduce potential customers to the business.
